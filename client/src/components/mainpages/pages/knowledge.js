          <p class="question">
            Is THC-O Legal?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, it is legal. We’re protected under the farm bill passed by Congress in 2018, because the molecule was derived from a chain of custody that began with federally legal hemp plants.
          </p>

          <p>
          As with products containing delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, products with THC-O exist in the marginal legal space between hemp (which is legal nationwide) and cannabis (which is not).
           State regulators and legislators are currently playing whack-a-mole with the growing number of hemp-derived compounds, banning novel compounds only to see new derivatives take their place.
          In legal adult-use states, cannabis regulators are by and large ignoring these hemp-derived compounds
           because they don’t fall under their strict regulatory purview. Local police and health authorities have more pressing matters, like violent crime and the coronavirus pandemic.

          <p class="question">
            Is this Fake/Synthetic?
          </p>
          <p>
            No, it is not fake or synthetic. It is made in a contracted lab using Delta-8 THC Distillate.

          <p class="question">
            Will a THC-O product make me test positive during a drug screening?
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the type of drug screening, YES it can.
